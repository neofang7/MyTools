Memuse is a memory usage analyzer that developed for Ostro OS.
This tool is a cross structure, users run it on a host machine to fetch and anlyze the memory status of a target machine. Currently, the target machine should be based on Intel Ostro.

Installation:
#1. Install python 2.7
#2. Install pip which is a python tool
#3. Install python modules with pip tool: libssh2, pexpect 

How to use:
--ip, -i <ip address>	IP address of the target machine.
--port, -p <port> 	Normally, it's 22.
--user, -u <user>	Root privilege required. By default it's 'root'. 
--password, -w <pass>	Password. By default 'iotos'
--load, -l <config>	This tool can test several target machines parallely. The related information of these target machines are defined in config/target_machine.xml.
--output, -o <dir>	Output the analysis result into the folder. Default is ./outputs.
--process, -s <pname>	If not set this option, memuse outputs all of the information about memory usage. 
	      		If set the process name, memuse outputs the memory usage of this process.

Examples:
#1. Test everython in one target machine,
$python memuse.py -i 10.239.13.109 -p 22

#2. Test one process in one target machine,
$python memuse.py -i 10.239.13.109 -p 22 -s sensord

#3. Test several target machines
$python memuse.py -l ./config/targets.xml
